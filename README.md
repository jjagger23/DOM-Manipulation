# DOM-Manipulation

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

## Features
- Toggleable **Filter Articles** menu
- Dynamic filtering of articles by type (Opinion, Recipe, Update)
- Toggleable **Add New Article** form
- Ability to dynamically create and insert new styled articles into the page

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

## How It Works
- Clicking **Filter Articles** displays checkboxes that allow users to show/hide articles by type.
- Clicking **Add New Article** displays a form where users can enter a title, select a type, and add article text.
- Newly added articles are dynamically created using JavaScript and styled automatically based on their type.

This project was built for a DOM manipulation assignment using GitHub Pages for deployment.
